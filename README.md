# asteroids
A basic game with personal additions; from the guided course on Boot.dev : "Build Asteroids using Python and Pygame"

## how to play!
- pilot the spaceship (wasd) to avoid asteroids (white circles) ; surviving accumulates points slowly
- shoot asteroids (spacebar) to accumulate points quickly
- crashing into an asteroid will lose a life (maximum 3 lives)
- regain lives by picking up health packs! (green circles)
